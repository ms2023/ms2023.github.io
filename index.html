            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science undergraduate working toward a career in software engineering
                and machine learning. I am most interested in problems that require careful reasoning
                and a solid understanding of how systems and data behave in practice, especially when
                performance and correctness matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Much of my work focuses on systems-level programming and analytical problem solving.
                I have built projects in C and x86-64 assembly that involve manual memory management,
                C and assembly interoperability, structured file processing, and low-level debugging.
                Working close to the hardware has shaped how I approach software development. I tend
                to prioritize clarity, correctness, and understanding why a solution works rather than
                relying purely on abstraction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alongside systems work, I am building experience in data analysis and machine learning.
                I enjoy working with real datasets where the challenge is not just implementing a model,
                but deciding how to explore the data, validate assumptions, and interpret results
                responsibly. I am especially interested in how models are trained and optimized, and
                how design and computational constraints influence their behavior in real systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                I bring a research-oriented mindset to my projects. I like breaking problems down,
                iterating on approaches, and revisiting assumptions when results do not align with
                expectations. Through tutoring and mentoring, I have also developed strong communication
                skills, which influence how I write code, document decisions, and explain technical ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently seeking internship opportunities where I can continue developing as a
                software engineer while moving toward machine learning and AI focused work, and where
                I can contribute to technically rigorous projects while learning from experienced teams.

                <h3>Wright Scholars Reseach Assistant</h3>
                <p><strong>Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) · Summers 2022 - 2025</strong></p>
                <div>
                    <h4>2025 · Research Batabase & Web Platform</h4>
                    <p>
                        During the 2025 Wright Scholars Research Program, I worked on a database-backed
                        web interface designed to support researchers in the Aerospace Directorate,
                        specifically within the Hypersonics branch. The goal of the project was to
                        centralize research papers and associated datasets into a single system that
                        allowed researchers to reference prior experiments, compare research conditions,
                        and supplement ongoing work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The system used a Flask-based web application with a SQLite database backend
                        to store papers, datasets, and metadata. To support large-scale ingestion of
                        existing research, the project incorporated prompt engineering techniques to
                        guide a custom-built large language model in extracting structured information
                        from papers and outputting standardized JSON files. These JSON outputs were
                        used to tag data and establish relationships between datasets based on defined
                        parameters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My primary focus was on project management, requirements gathering, and iterative
                        web interface design. I worked closely with researchers to understand how they
                        searched for prior work and what information was most valuable to surface, then
                        helped translate those needs into concrete features and development tasks. This
                        involved organizing project milestones, refining requirements over multiple
                        iterations, and ensuring the interface remained usable for domain experts in a
                        field unfamiliar to the development team.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Development followed a feedback-driven process, with regular check-ins and
                        interface revisions based on researcher input. Through this project, I gained
                        experience bridging the gap between domain experts and software systems,
                        supporting AI-assisted data processing workflows, and contributing to the
                        development of a maintainable, research-oriented web application.

                    <h4>2024 · Multi-Player Educational Role-Playing Game (MPERPG)</h4>
                    <p>
                        MPERPG was a multiplayer leadership training simulation built in Unreal Engine 5
                        using a client-server architecture. The goal of the project was to create
                        collaborative scenarios where multiple players had to communicate and make
                        decisions together under time pressure. The simulation relied on network
                        replication to keep all players in sync and included cooperative challenges
                        such as a procedurally generated maze and a minefield navigation task.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My work focused on implementing core gameplay systems and supporting the
                        multiplayer functionality that kept player actions, objectives, and environment
                        state consistent across clients. I worked with replicated actors and shared state
                        updates, and spent time debugging issues related to desynchronization and timing
                        in a real-time networked setting. I also contributed to character customization
                        and animation systems to make player roles clearer and interactions more intuitive.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I additionally helped integrate data logging features that recorded key player
                        actions and events into structured CSV files for later analysis by researchers
                        and instructors. The project followed an iterative development process driven by
                        frequent feedback from stakeholders, which meant regularly revisiting requirements,
                        making targeted code changes, and refining systems over multiple development cycles.
                        Through this process, I gained experience working in a shared codebase and translating
                        user and customer needs into concrete technical improvements.

                    <h4>2023 · Cultural Linguistic A.I. Model (CLAIM)</h4>
                     <p>
                        C.L.A.I.M. was an AI-driven conversational NPC system developed in Unity to support
                        cultural and linguistic training in a serious game environment. The goal of the
                        project was to create non-player characters capable of engaging in realistic,
                        spoken dialogue while responding appropriately to user input and context through
                        an AI-powered text-to-speech pipeline.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My primary role focused on character integration and project organization. I worked
                        closely with the customer to understand their goals for NPC behavior and interaction,
                        and helped break high-level requirements into concrete, achievable development tasks
                        for the team. This involved translating non-technical expectations into specific
                        features and coordinating implementation across different parts of the system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On the technical side, I created character animations manually in Blender and
                        integrated them into Unity to support expressive NPC behavior. I also worked on
                        implementing lip-sync functionality by integrating the Oculus Lip Sync library
                        with the text-to-speech pipeline, ensuring that spoken dialogue aligned with facial
                        animation in real time. This required coordinating animation timing, audio playback,
                        and character state within the engine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The project followed an iterative, feedback-driven development process, with regular
                        reviews and adjustments based on customer input. Through this experience, I became
                        more familiar with managing evolving requirements, organizing work in a collaborative
                        codebase, and bridging the gap between customer expectations and technical
                        implementation.

                    <h4>2022 · Teams in Danger</h4>
                    <p>
                        Teams in Danger was a cooperative multiplayer search and rescue simulation
                        developed for the Air Force Research Laboratory's Gaming Research Integration
                        for Learning Laboratory (GRILL). The project focused on studying teamwork,
                        communication, and decision-making in emergency response scenarios using a
                        realistic, research-driven game environment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The simulation placed players in a building collapse scenario where they had
                        to coordinate across distinct roles to locate, stabilize, and evacuate victims
                        under time pressure. The system supported multiple player roles with specialized
                        abilities, dynamic hazards such as fire and electrical obstacles, and a beacon
                        communication system that allowed players to mark victims and hazards in real time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I worked on core gameplay systems and multiplayer functionality in Unreal Engine
                        4 using Blueprints. This included implementing role-based mechanics, hazard
                        interactions, and victim handling systems. I built a randomized hazard spawner to
                        dynamically generate challenges, and organized ~20 characters, assigning them
                        randomized animations from ~10 variations to represent different victim states. 
                        I designed severity levels with descriptive indicators and implemented a system 
                        to randomly assign severity to each character.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, I contributed to features that supported research data collection,
                        including systems that logged player actions and events to structured JSON files
                        for later analysis. Throughout development, the project followed an iterative,
                        customer-driven process, requiring regular feedback sessions and adjustments to
                        meet research needs. Through this experience, I gained early exposure to
                        collaborative development, version control, and building systems that balance
                        technical constraints with real-world research requirements.

                <h3>Research Intern</h3>
                <p><strong>The VisionLab, University of Dayton</strong></p>

                <p>
                    As a research intern at the VisionLab, I worked on a project involving data
                    collected from an EEG headset, with the goal of identifying and organizing
                    signals from the sensor with the strongest readings. The project required
                    working with raw sensor data and developing tooling to process and analyze
                    that data reliably.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My work focused on building a Python-based data processing pipeline that
                    ingested EEG readings, grouped data by sensor, and identified dominant signal
                    patterns. I used libraries such as NumPy and pandas to clean, manipulate, and
                    analyze structured data, and Matplotlib to visualize trends and validate
                    results during development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This role gave me hands-on experience working with real-world, noisy datasets
                    in a research setting, where requirements evolved as insights were discovered.
                    I became more comfortable iterating on analysis code, validating assumptions
                    through visualization, and communicating technical findings to researchers
                    with different backgrounds.

                <h3>Instructor</h3>
                <p><strong>Mathnasium of Centerville</strong></p>

                <p>
                    As an instructor at Mathnasium, I worked with students across K–12, covering a
                    wide range of topics from foundational number line arithmetic to advanced high
                    school material and ACT preparation. The role required quickly assessing a
                    student’s current understanding and adapting instruction to meet their
                    individual needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I regularly broke down complex concepts into smaller, approachable steps and
                    guided students through structured problem-solving strategies. This included
                    reinforcing core mathematical intuition, addressing gaps in prerequisite
                    knowledge, and helping students build confidence with standardized test-style
                    questions under time constraints.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This experience strengthened my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly
                    to a non-technical audience and to adjust explanations in real time based on
                    feedback. These skills have directly carried over into my software and research
                    work, especially when collaborating with teammates, explaining system behavior,
                    or translating high-level goals into actionable steps.

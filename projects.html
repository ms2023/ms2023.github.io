                <h3>Unix Shell Extensions and Process Management</h3>

                <p>
                    This project extends a provided Unix shell skeleton by implementing core
                    systems-level functionality related to process execution, signal handling,
                    and persistent command history. My work focused on integrating operating
                    system concepts into an existing command-parsing framework rather than
                    building a shell entirely from scratch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I implemented process creation and execution using <code>fork</code>,
                    <code>execvp</code>, and <code>wait</code>, enabling both foreground and
                    background command execution. I also added a persistent command history
                    mechanism backed by file I/O, allowing commands to be stored across sessions
                    and re-executed through a custom history recall interface.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The shell supports asynchronous behavior through signal handling, including
                    a <code>SIGINT</code> handler that allows users to view command history without
                    terminating the shell. Internally, recent commands are managed using a
                    fixed-size circular buffer, requiring careful state management and edge-case
                    handling.
                </p>

                <h3>Multiple Sclerosis Progression Simulation</h3>

                <p>
                    I built a Python-based simulation to model simplified cycles of demyelination
                    and remyelination in Multiple Sclerosis. The simulation represents neurons as
                    nodes in a randomly generated graph and tracks neuron health over time using
                    configurable damage and recovery rates. This allowed me to explore how varying
                    disease severity and treatment parameters impact overall system behavior.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The system initializes a neural network using NetworkX, assigns health values
                    to each neuron, and visualizes disease progression through color-coded nodes.
                    The simulation alternates between demyelination and remyelination phases, where
                    neurons probabilistically lose or regain health based on parameterized inputs.
                    Matplotlib is used to render each iteration, making changes in neuron health
                    easy to observe and compare across simulation steps.
